# AIP Science Apps

## Test Runner

This package is a test runner environment useful for building Science Apps
for the Arabidopsis Information Portal (AIP).

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js + npm](http://nodejs.org/)
- grunt
  - `npm install -g grunt-cli`

After those are installed, clone this repo, cd into the directory, and run:
